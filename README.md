# Super FunTime

## Description
This project is an attempt to use some of the algorithms I learned earlier this year to practice utilising React to display the algorithm in action.


## Setup
Install dependendencies via `yarn`

Run the application via `yarn start`


## Solution??
Display a grid of 100x100 square to begin with (probably each will be a single div)
Hovering over a square should highlight
